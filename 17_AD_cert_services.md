# Active Directory Certificate Services

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is a server role that allows you to build a public key infrastructure (PKI).  This can provide public key cryptography, digital certificates, and digital signature capabilities.  Some practical applications include Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME), secure wireless networks, virtual private network (VPN), Internet Protocol security (IPsec), Encrypting File System (EFS), smart card logon, and Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).

Correct implementation can improve the security of an organisation:

    Confidentiality through encryption.
    Integrity through digital signatures.
    Authentication by associating certificate keys with computer, user, or device accounts on the network.
